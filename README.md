JS-learning-experiments
=======================

A bunch of random JS learning experiments I've made while reading EloquentJS, running through Node.

How to run these files
----------------------

Make sure Node.js is installed. Then in your terminal, type 'node' and the filename, ex:

```
node fizzbuzz.js
```
